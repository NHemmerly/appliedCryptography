hello this is sample plaintext to be encrypted and analyzed. I will now create more words and letters for this text to be properly analyzed by my 
program. Having additional letters to sample from will allow the encrypted information to be more adequately compared to english as letter frequencies 
will be more prevalent in a larger piece of text. Wow I really am just blabbing on now, well why don't you get to it? how long of a piece of text do 
I need to make in order to get the proper letter frequency? are there really enough E's? Who knows, but we will probably find out soon. Continue writing 
kneel!
